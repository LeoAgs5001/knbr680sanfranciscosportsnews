<p>Baseball superstars. What do they do in the offseason? Many train. Many spend time with family. Or they play more baseball in other leagues around the world. But Jung-hoo Lee, the San Francisco Giants&rsquo; major offseason addition, whom we haven&rsquo;t seen much of since his press conference, spent some time getting to know the area around Oracle Park &mdash; and drinking lots of orange juice.</p>
<p>In a YouTube vlog put out by his old team, the Kiwoom Heroes of the KBO League, the 25-year-old outfielder eats chicken wings at Public House, the craft beer bar next to the entrance of the Giants&rsquo; home stadium. The night before, Lee was at the Golden State Warriors game and was put on the jumbotron, which he called &ldquo;embarrassing, but &hellip; a pleasant experience.&rdquo; The video shows Lee speaking Korean the entire time, and SFGATE translated the video using Google Translate.</p>
<p>With the help of an English-Korean translator &mdash; something Lee will likely have with him throughout his first season with the Giants &mdash; Lee orders a Stella Artois beer along with the wings. But the first thing he does is drink half of a pint glass of orange juice with ice cubes and makes an exaggerated &ldquo;ahhh&rdquo; sound for the camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s the best thing about coming to America?&rdquo; he asks his film producer/translator. &ldquo;No matter which restaurant you go to, they sell orange juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lee goes on to explain that his mom always gave him orange juice growing up and he always has three bottles of it at his home. However, in South Korea, orange juice is usually only sold at convenience stores. When dining in South Korea, he often buys it in a convenience store and brings it into restaurants, he says.</p>
