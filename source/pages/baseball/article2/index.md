# MLB Blue Jays

<p>As the Toronto Blue Jays look to improve their offense this year, they are reportedly looking at free agent first baseman Joey Votto and trade target Eugenio Suarez.<br />The Toronto Blue Jays, fresh off getting swept in the American League wild card round of the playoffs, are reportedly looking to add offense this offseason.<br />This makes sense, considering Toronto's lineup scuffled at times in 2023 - and because Matt Chapman, Whit Merrifield, Kevin Kiermaier and Brandon Belt are all free agents who need to be re-signed or replaced.<br />According to Ben Nicholson-Smith of SportsNet, the Jays are looking at multiple solutions to their offensive woes:<br />One of those possible solutions could be to sign Joey Votto. He would essentially be a replacement for Belt as a first base/designated hitter combo. The 40-year-old Reds' legend is a Toronto native and GM Ross Atkins acknowledged what he could do for the organization.<br />&ldquo;Incredible player, remarkable career,&rdquo; Atkins said. "They're just massive impact in the community if he were to be a Toronto Blue Jay. So definitely something that we would have to consider if that was something he wanted to pursue.&rdquo;<br />Now 40, Votto appears likely to land a one-year deal. The Blue Jays have done lots of background work on him, and remain impressed.<br />&ldquo;Incredible reputation, really dynamic personality, really bright (person) that I know our team would embrace,&rdquo; Atkins said. &ldquo;But I think that's the case for probably 15 teams.&rdquo;<br />Nicholson-Smith also mentions that the team could look to trade for Seattle Mariners' third baseman Eugenio Suarez. He would serve as a replacement for Chapman. Though he strikes out a lot (214 times, most in baseball), he plays good defense and hits for power. He did have 22 homers last year and has hit 20 or more in each season since 2016 (except COVID 2020).<br />It's unclear at this time if the Mariners are looking to move him, but it's still something the Jays are reportedly looking into. He's in the final year of his contract and is owed $11 million. There's a $15 million club option for 2024.</p>
