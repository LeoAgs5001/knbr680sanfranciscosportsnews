# MBL Kansas City Royals

<p>As the postseason rolls on, it&rsquo;s been relatively quiet for non-postseason teams like the Royals.<br />That&rsquo;s not unusual in October. The Royals held their end-of-season press conference a few days after their season ended, in which general manager J.J. Picollo laid out plans for the offseason, but until the World Series is over, teams can&rsquo;t make significant roster moves. In the meantime, the Royals held their annual organizational meetings and have been discussing new hires to the coaching staff and front office that could elevate this team, as well as planning their offseason targets.<br />So don&rsquo;t worry. News and moves will be coming soon. Let&rsquo;s answer some questions about what those might be. Thanks to everyone who submitted their queries via X:</p>
<p>How active do they plan to be in the free agent market this offseason? -- @shzott</p>
<p>One of the more interesting things I thought Picollo mentioned in his end-of-season presser is the 2024 rotation. He gave three names: Cole Ragans, Brady Singer and Jordan Lyles.<br />&ldquo;The rest of them are competing and may come from the outside,&rdquo; Picollo said.<br />The Royals do have several internal candidates to fill those two spots, but it appears Picollo doesn&rsquo;t want to completely count on them. For example, the Royals can&rsquo;t assume that Daniel Lynch IV or Kris Bubic will bounce back from their injuries, or that rookie Alec Marsh will take a huge leap forward in his second season. It&rsquo;s always better to have depth, and that&rsquo;s something the Royals didn&rsquo;t have this year. So expect Kansas City to acquire pitching, both starting and relieving, externally this winter.<br />Picollo also stated a desire to bring in an impact bat, likely in the outfield, but there aren&rsquo;t a ton of options there this winter. Diving into the trade market, which the Royals have been willing to do, seems more likely.</p>
<p>Too early to be scouting pitchers we might be looking at or pending FA that might be a good fit? -- @simonsaysjoshd</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never too early -- what else are we supposed to do while we wait for baseball to return?<br />There are going to be several top tier free agent pitchers this offseason, like Sonny Gray and Blake Snell. Both Jordan Montgomery and Aaron Nola are pitching their way into that tier this postseason. Eduardo Rodriguez and Seth Lugo could fit here if they decline their player options.<br />It&rsquo;s not likely the Royals are going to be in a bidding war for the top pitcher on the market. The second tier is interesting, though, if the Royals are serious about acquiring someone who can help them take a step forward.<br />This group includes players like Lucas Giolito and Jack Flaherty, both of whom are coming off years they struggled but with upside. Michael Lorenzen could fit here, too; he was great for the Tigers this past year, threw a no-hitter in Philly and then had an 8.79 ERA in September.<br />That&rsquo;s a peek into the starting market, and I plan on diving into the relief market at some point this offseason. But the Royals have options once they determine their budget for 2024.</p>
<p>Is the Bobby Witt extension the #1 priority for the club this offseason? -- @KC_Saluki</p>
<p>The No. 1 priority is to acquire players (mainly pitching) that will help turn around a 106-loss team into something, well, better than 106 losses. That&rsquo;s going to be what affects next year the most, given that Bobby Witt Jr. is a Royal for four more years before hitting free agency.<br />That being said, signing Witt to a long-term deal is something the Royals want to do. What that deal looks like and when it gets done are two big questions. As well as what Witt wants. When does he want to hit free agency? Is he willing to sign a deal to stay in Kansas City his entire career?<br />The Royals are likely going to have to get creative with a contract (perhaps like Julio Rodr&iacute;guez&rsquo;s contract in Seattle) to appease ownership, keep up with the market and find middle ground with Witt and his representation. Laying the foundation for that should happen this offseason. Ensuring their superstar stays in Kansas City for more than the next four years would go a long way for this franchise.</p>
