<p>The Philadelphia Phillies are in Atlanta and there are mere hours before the hotly-anticipated Game 1 of the National League Divisional Series. As anticipated, the roster is out and there are some changes to be noticed.</p>
<p>Here is the Phillies&rsquo; 2023 NLDS roster:<br />Catchers (2): J.T. Realmuto, Garrett Stubbs<br />Infielders (5): Bryce Harper, Bryson Stott, Trea Turner, Alec Bohm, Edmundo Sosa<br />Outfielders (6): Nick Castellanos, Johan Rojas, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber, Cristian Pache, Jake Cave<br />Pitchers (13): Zack Wheeler, Aaron Nola, Ranger Suarez, Craig Kimbrel, Jose Alvarado, Jeff Hoffman, Seranthony Dominguez, Gregory Soto, Matt Strahm, Orion Kerkering, Cristopher Sanchez, Taijuan Walker, Michael Lorenzen.<br />One of the most noticeable changes is that Michael Lorenzen is the 13th member of their pitching staff and removed corner infielder/outfielder Weston Wilson. <br />Now the shorter NL Wild Card series made more sense to carry a fifth bench player than to have a 13th man in the pitching corner. Now with a longer five-game series, it would be more beneficial to have another arm.<br />Philadelphia Phillies starting pitcher Michael Lorenzen aims a pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Miami Marlins, Thursday, Aug. 3, 2023, in Miami.

But even during the regular season, Lorenzen was useful. He threw 40 more innings this season than his previous career-high but struggled in six appearances after his August no-hitter, allowing 30 runs in 26 1/3 innings.<br />Concerns aren&rsquo;t too prevalent as there&rsquo;s enough time between games that each team can rest their bullpen. Manager Rob Thomson will be able to use Lorenzen against the numerous right-handed batters that Atlanta will produce.</p>
