<p>Thompson joins truly elite company among the most accomplished shooters in NBA history.<br />Klay Thompson&rsquo;s injury-delayed ascent in the NBA record books is back on track.<br />The Warriors icon passed Jamal Crawford for 10th all-time in made 3-pointers in Sunday&rsquo;s game at Houston. Thompson accomplished the feat in vintage fashion, catching a pass in transition and, without dribbling, rising well behind the arc to drill his 2,222nd career 3-pointer.<br />The five-time All-Star and four-time NBA champion has restored the Warriors&rsquo; historic &ldquo;Splash Brothers&rdquo; pairing of Thompson and Stephen Curry after missing the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons due to knee and Achilles surgeries.<br />Thompson may need extra games to catch 9th-place and still-active LeBron James on the made 3-pointers list. Retired and renowned shooters such as Jason Terry (8th) and Vince Carter (7th) sit slightly higher.</p>
