# 49ERS

<p>Kyle Shanahan&rsquo;s clock management to end the first half of the 49ers-Packers playoff game left many scratching their heads at how an ostensibly brilliant head coach bungled a clear scoring opportunity for his team.</p>
<p>The 49ers&rsquo; offense received the ball at their 25-yard line with 4:09 remaining in the first half after Green Bay cut San Francisco&rsquo;s lead to one point, 7-6. By 1:26 left in the second quarter, the Niners were at the Packers&rsquo; 46-yard line with all three timeouts remaining.</p>
<p>From that moment on, it became abundantly clear that Shanahan&rsquo;s goal was to play for a field goal to end the half, and prevent the Packers from getting a shot at getting any late first-half points of their own by running down the clock. However, many Shanahan observers on social media could sense the conservative approach coming from the instant the Niners got the ball back.</p>
<p>The Shanahan approach to clock management has been a frequent source of criticism for the 49ers&rsquo; head coach, dating all the way back to the 2016 Super Bowl, where the Falcons just didn&rsquo;t run down the clock and ultimately blew a 28-3 second-half lead to the New England Patriots. The stakes aren&rsquo;t nearly as high in this game, but the coach had the ability to go for seven points with an incredibly talented offense &mdash; so talented that it&rsquo;s often used against quarterback Brock Purdy in regard to whether he&rsquo;s a good player &mdash; and instead chose for a much more cowardly three.</p>
<p>So how did this game plan of short yardage plays and focusing on field position over going for a touchdown work out? After letting the clock run down to 10 seconds left in the half, rookie kicker Jake Moody lined up for a late field goal that was ultimately blocked. All of that strange clock management in an attempt to go for a lousy three points ended up for nothing. Oh, and the 49ers went three-and-out to open the second half, too.</p>
<p>If the 49ers lose Saturday&rsquo;s game, this moment will be looked back on with a lot more disdain than it already is.</p>
