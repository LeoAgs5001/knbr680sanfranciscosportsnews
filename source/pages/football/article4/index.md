<p>Injuries have been jolted the Philadelphia Eagles to start the 2023 campaign. The team is down several key starters through the first four weeks, including right guard Cam Jurgens. Not to worry, the backup plan at that position brings certifiable street cred.<br />Sua Opeta will draw the start at right guard when the Eagles take on the Rams in Los Angeles. The 6-foot-4, 305-pounder graded out very well in relief of Jurgens last week &mdash; &ldquo;outstanding,&rdquo; according to head coach Nick Sirianni &mdash; and now he&rsquo;ll be tasked with blocking Aaron Donald in Week 5. Opeta is ready for the challenge.<br />Weber State offensive lineman Sua Opeta answers questions from the media during the NFL Scouting Combine on February 28, 2019 at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis, IN.

He&rsquo;s a guy who has all the physical traits, plus he puts his hard hat on and goes to work. No questions asked.<br />&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got that zero to 60 torque, too. He&rsquo;s got a little Tesla torque to him,&rdquo; Jason Kelce said. &ldquo;Sua&rsquo;s come a long way in his career here in Philadelphia, and he does some amazing things and when he&rsquo;s on he&rsquo;s a pretty unbelievable player.&rdquo;<br />The undrafted kid out of Weber State be making his fifth career start when he takes the field on Sunday afternoon, although he&rsquo;s seen plenty of meaningful snaps over the years. Opeta received 43 snaps last week after Jurgens left with a foot injury.</p>
