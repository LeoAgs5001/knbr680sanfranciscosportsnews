<p class="p1">Mac Jones, Hunter Henry, and Jahlani Tavai weigh in.</p>
<p class="p1">With Christian Gonzalez out for the season and three more cornerbacks on injured reserve, the Patriots turned to a familiar face to add depth to their secondary.</p>
<p class="p1">The Patriots traded for J.C. Jackson on Wednesday, reuniting the 2021 Pro Bowler with the organization he started his career with.</p>
<p class="p1">Patriots tight-end Hunter Henry said he&rsquo;s excited to see Jackson return to Foxborough.</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;Well, that year he made a lot of plays, that&rsquo;s for sure,&rdquo; Henry said. &ldquo;He was a ballhawk. He was around the ball, it seemed like, all the time. So, I&rsquo;m excited to have a guy like that back in the scheme. He made a lot of plays when I was here. Excited to see him do that again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">Quarterback Mac Jones remembers learning from Jackson and practicing against the speedy corner.</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;JC was a great player,&rdquo; Jones said. &ldquo;Obviously, he taught me a lot during my rookie year. He was just aggressive. There are a lot of corners that play like him, but he&rsquo;s very unique. He&rsquo;s fast, he&rsquo;s aggressive. He has a really good knack for the ball, so yeah, he&rsquo;s a good player.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">Injuries forced the Patriots to make a move and address the cornerback position. Jackson admitted he&rsquo;s not 100 percent healthy during a recent interview with The Athletic.</p>
<p class="p1">But, if he can return to a level similar to the one he was on when he left, the risk to bring him in could be worth a big reward.</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;He had great years when he was here. I&rsquo;m excited to see him back in a Patriot uniform doing what he does,&rdquo; linebacker Jahlani Tavai said. &ldquo;When he&rsquo;s back in the building, it will be exciting but for now we&rsquo;re going to work with what we have and everybody that has an opportunity to play, I hope that they take full advantage.&rdquo;</p>
