<p class="p1">The New Orleans Saints were dealt a potential setback amid their hot start.</p>
<p class="p1">Quarterback Derek Carr was knocked out of Sunday's 18-17 loss to the Green Bay Packers with a right shoulder injury after being sacked in the third quarter. He was initially listed as questionable to return before later being ruled out.</p>
<p class="p1">After the game, he was taken to a hospital for further examination, Saints coach Dennis Allen said after the game.</p>
<p class="p1">Carr remained down on the field after he was taken down by Packers outside linebacker Rashan Gary, who tallied his second sack of three sacks on the day. Carr was eventually helped off the field by Saints staffers and went to the locker room to be evaluated.</p>
<p class="p1">After the Saints punted on the ensuing fourth down, backup quarterback Jameis Winston replaced Carr in the lineup.</p>
<p class="p1">With the 10th-year veteran out of the lineup, New Orleans gave up 18 unanswered points as the team suffered its first loss of the year. Rookie kicker Blake Grupe had an opportunity to help the team retake the lead in the final two minutes, but he missed a 46-yard field goal.</p>
<p class="p1">Carr completed 13 of 18 passes for 103 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game, while Winston finished with 101 yards on 10-of-16 passing.</p>
