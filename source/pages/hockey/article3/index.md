<p>A week before the Blues made Dalibor Dvorsky the No. 10 pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, the Slovakian center made it official that he was changing clubs in Europe for the 2023-24 season.<br />After playing two seasons with AIK in Sweden&rsquo;s second-highest hockey league (Allsvenskan), Dvorsky signed a two-year contract with IK Oskarshamn in the country&rsquo;s top league (Swedish Hockey League).<br />&ldquo;There were teams interested, so he had to choose between Allsvenskan and the SHL,&rdquo; J.P. Barry of CAA Hockey, Dvorsky&rsquo;s agent, told The Athletic on Wednesday. &ldquo;Eventually, the SHL club made a big case that they would develop him, and by mid-year, he should be able to play in a top-six (forward) role.&rdquo;<br />However, the situation did not play out as planned, and on Wednesday, Oskarshamn announced that the sides had mutually agreed to terminate Dvorsky&rsquo;s contract. The Blues later confirmed that he was being re-assigned to the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).<br />&ldquo;After evaluating Dalibor&rsquo;s situations in Sweden, and talking with him and his representatives, we jointly decided that the opportunity to play regular minutes at Sudbury against his peer group in the OHL would be the best thing for his development,&rdquo; Blues general manager Doug Armstrong said in a statement. &ldquo;We look forward to watching his continued growth as a player.&rdquo;<br />The situation in Sweden has been playing out for the past month or so and became an issue that needed to be addressed in the past couple of weeks.<br />Dvorsky, 18, wasn&rsquo;t progressing toward a top-six role with Oskarshamn &mdash; and in fact didn&rsquo;t have much of a role at all. The club was in last place (14th) in the SHL standings with a record of 2-8. Dvorsky didn&rsquo;t have any points, and his ice time had been limited to just 1 minute, 35 seconds and 44 seconds in the past two games, respectively.<br />Barry and the Blues were monitoring the situation closely.<br />&ldquo;We saw the ice time he was getting in the early going,&rdquo; Barry said. &ldquo;Then the team struggled and I thought it would start getting better, but it got worse. They started losing, and the pressure over there, you&rsquo;re thinking they&rsquo;re going to get relegated and the whole business part sets in. It&rsquo;s not a good environment for an 18-year-old player who really needs to play every day.&rdquo;</p>
